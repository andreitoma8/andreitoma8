  GM, reader! Ever since I was young I enjoyed building. Back then it was Lego, now it's Smart Contracts on the Blockchain. Being a developer encompasses the thing I love the most: bringing my vision to reality, solving logic problems and generating value for the people around me.

As a Web3 developer, my mission is to leverage my deep understanding of smart contracts and Ethereum to help turn innovative ideas into reality and make a positive impact on people's lives all over the world. I am a firm believer that Decentralisation through Blockchain technology represents the next step in humanity's digital evolution and I am committed to using my problem-solving skills to advance this mission.
  
  I now carry out my personal mission at Nethermind. Our mission is to deliver cutting-edge research & development to allow accessible, transparent, borderless economy and governance.
