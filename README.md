  Hi there, dear reader! Ever since I was young I enjoyed building. Back then it was Lego, now it's Smart Contracts on the Blockchain. Being a developer encompasses the thing I love the most: bringing my vision to reality, solving logic problems and generating value for the people around me.

  My mission as a Web3 developer is to help people with innovative ideas bring them to reality and make an impact in the lives of people all across the world. I truly believe Blockchain is the new internet and the next step in humanity's digital evolution.
  
  Thank you for taking the time to read my story and if you share my passion or excitement for a decentralised future don't hesitate to contact me [@toma_andrei8](https://twitter.com/toma_andrei8) on Twitter!
