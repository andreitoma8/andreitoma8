  GM, reader! Ever since I was young I enjoyed building. Back then it was Lego, now it's Smart Contracts on the Blockchain. Being a developer encompasses the thing I love the most: bringing my vision to reality, solving logic problems and generating value for the people around me.

  My mission as a Web3 developer is to help people with innovative ideas bring them to reality and make an impact in the lives of people all across the world. I truly believe Decentralisation trough Blockchain technology is the next step in humanity's digital evolution.
  
  I now carry out my personal mission at @NethermindEth : Nethermind's mission is to deliver cutting-edge research & development to allow accessible, transparent, borderless economy and governance.

  We pursue our mission by delivering **great products** and **expert consulting** fostering the development of decentralized solutions.

  We work with the most effective and visionary partners, helping them to achieve their strategic goals and supporting them through the ups and downs of the industry cycles.

  Nethermind's growth is based on its ability to benefit from long-term partnerships. We build long-term relationships through excellence, loyalty, and support in difficult times.

  Timing, expertise, and long-term partnerships allow Nethermind to find opportunities within the industry and partner with great projects at the early stage.
